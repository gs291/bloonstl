### siteColors.js

When the project was initially created MUI (formerly Material UI) was only needed to borrow a few components.
Due to this a MUI theme was never incorporated due to the small use case of MUI components.
As the project progressed more components were used by MUI. 
Unfortunately, by the time it was realized that an MUI theme would be helpful it was too late.
It was too late in the sense that since this siteColors "theme" was so deeply incorporated it would be waste of time and resources to change something that's not broken.

With that being said, if it is found that incorporating a MUI theme would drastically improve performance then it will be done.
Create an issue if this is the case.
