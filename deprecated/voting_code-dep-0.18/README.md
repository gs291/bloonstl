## Idea: Voting Mechanism for the Website

> Since there is no api or data provided by Nijiakiwi on statistics about player matches (e.g. Towers that get the highest round and damage output). 
> This idea was created to bring some sort of way to rank towers/abilities.
> 
> The code contains database, API endpoints, utilities and components that are used to allow users to vote for the following:
> 
> - Towers (i.e. Monkeys/Heroes) for a tier list position ranging from C to S tier.
> - Monkey Ability Paths (e.g. 5-2-0) for a tier list position ranging from C to S tier.
>
> 
> A voting page with a voting form was created to easily vote for what tower was thought to be the best. 
> A range for tiers were able to be chosen from best to worst: S, A, B, C tier.
> 
> The data was going to be analyzed per day and refreshed on each update to give up-to-date tier list data.
> 
> This idea was ultimately removed due to how unreliable and unused this would get. 
> Due to a smaller (but still strong!) player base (compared to the top games out) there would not get many votes out per patch/new update. 
> That reason alone is also why it would most likely get unused from people voting once or twice and never again. 
> An old vote would get "deleted" with a new update.
