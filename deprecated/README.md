# Deprecated Files



> This directory contains all the unused ideas from the project.
> 
> The code is saved in an easy browsing location of everything.

### Understanding
> Each deprecated folder is an idea and its version it was deprecated from.
> (e.g. idea: voting_code, version: 0.18, dep: deprecated)
> 
> Each deprecation is in the same file structure the project was at that time. Each file contains only the deprecated code from the file.
